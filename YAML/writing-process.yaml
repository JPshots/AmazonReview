  integrated_writing_process:
    principle: "Write with simultaneous attention to information and personality"
    techniques:
      - "Draft each section with its pre-determined balance level in mind"
      - "Place creative elements at pre-planned strategic points"
      - "Follow complex sentences with simpler ones for rhythm"
      - "Monitor sentence variety during initial drafting rather than revision"
      - "Front-load factual information before adding personality elements"

      - "End higher-complexity sections with a simpler transitional sentence"
      - "Begin lower-complexity sections with personality before technical details"
      - "Use thematic elements selectively to bridge different complexity levels"
      - "Connect sections with logical progression of ideas"
      - "Reference preceding sections when building on previously established concepts"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Write complete sections rather than fragmented parts"
    - "Balance information and personality from the beginning rather than adding personality later"
    - "Ensure factual accuracy before adding creative elements"

# Artifact Versioning
# =============================================================================
artifact_versioning:
  critical_rules:
    priority: "highest"
      - id: "single_version_per_response"
    definition: "Each response must contain a maximum of one artifact version update"
    rationale: "Multiple updates in a single response create confusion and unnecessarily increase chat length"
    implementation:
      - "Collect all feedback points before making any changes"
      - "Use a single \"update\" command for minor changes or \"rewrite\" for major revisions"
      - "Bundle all requested modifications into this single operation"
      - "If changes are substantial, default to \"rewrite\" rather than multiple \"update\" commands"
    validation:
      check: "Confirm each response contains no more than one artifact command"
  
  best_practices:
    - "Use \"update\" for targeted changes to specific sections"
    - "Use \"rewrite\" for substantial revisions affecting multiple sections"
    - "Limit \"update\" to 4 times per message maximum to reduce conversation length"
    - "When using \"update\", provide both old_str and new_str with precise matching"
    - "Prefer making changes to the minimal set of chunks necessary"
  
  decision_guidance:
    scenarios:
      - condition: "Changes affect 30% or more of content"
        action: "Use rewrite"
      - condition: "Changes are isolated to specific sentences"
        action: "Use update"
      - condition: "Multiple small changes throughout"
        action: "Use rewrite"
      - condition: "Need to make 5+ distinct updates"
        action: "Use rewrite instead of multiple updates"
  
  chat_size_optimization:
    priority: "highest"
    techniques:
      - "Always favor a single rewrite over multiple updates when changes are extensive"
      - "Keep old_str selections as small as possible while maintaining uniqueness"
      - "Batch related changes together when possible"
      - "Consider conversation length impact when choosing between update and rewrite"
