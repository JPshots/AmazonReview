      - "Always place factual content first, personality second"
      - "Enhance the most distinctive or important features"
      - "Ensure enhancement complements rather than competes with core information"
    example:

      enhanced: "Clear progress indicators for each battery position (no cryptic blinking patterns to decipher)"

# =============================================================================
# Title and Header Formatting
# =============================================================================
title_header_formatting:
  description: "Strategic formatting for titles and headers to enhance visibility and organization"

# =============================================================================
# Paragraph and List Formatting
# =============================================================================
content_formatting:
  description: "Guidelines for formatting paragraphs and lists for maximum readability"
  
  paragraphs:
    guidelines:
      - "Keep paragraphs brief (3-5 sentences) for scannability"
      - "Start with the most important information"
      - "Vary paragraph length throughout the review"
      - "Use single-sentence paragraphs sparingly for emphasis"
      - "Include specific details (measurements, prices) in appropriate paragraphs"
    example: |
      I heard the *clink* from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction. Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity, one of our $9 duo chose a more... theatrical exit.
  
  lists:
    guidelines:
      - "Use bullet points (-, •) for unordered lists"
      - "Use checkmarks (✓) for positive points, X (✗) for negative points"
      - "Keep list items concise and scannable"
      - "Start list items with strong action verbs or key facts when possible"
      - "Apply the 30-40% personality enhancement rule selectively"
      - "Group related items together for logical flow"
    example: |
      ✓ PROS
      - Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses
      - Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)
      - Pour spout that actually works
      - Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science

      ✗ CONS
      - Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique
      - Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe
      - Advertised as 3oz, but highest marking is 2.5oz (though there's bonus space above)

# =============================================================================
# Thematic Section Headers
# =============================================================================
thematic_formatting:
  description: "Creating cohesive thematic formatting throughout reviews"
  
  principles:
    - "Section titles should reflect both function and theme"
    - "Maintain consistent symbol and formatting conventions across themed sections"
    - "Ensure thematic headings still clearly communicate section purpose"
    - "Use ALL CAPS format for all section headers regardless of theme"
  
  example_themes:
    - theme: "Kitchen Science Lab"
      sections:
        - functional: "Experiential"
          themed: "► THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS"
        - functional: "Evaluation"
          themed: "■ LABORATORY OBSERVATIONS"
        - functional: "Practical"
          themed: "※ FIELD NOTES"
        - functional: "Conclusion"
          themed: "► RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS"

          themed: "※ SURVIVAL TACTICS"
        - functional: "Conclusion"
          themed: "► EXPEDITION REPORT"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Maintain symbol consistency across all section headers"
    - "Ensure thematic section names are immediately understandable"
    - "Use themed headers consistently throughout the entire review"
    - "Consider how the full set of headers works together visually"

# =============================================================================
# Style Personalization
# =============================================================================
style_personalization:
  description: "Guidelines for developing a personal formatting style across reviews"
  
  signature_elements:
    description: "Creating consistent personal branding elements"
    recommendations:
      - "Select 3-5 consistent formatting techniques for all your reviews"
      - "Use the same header decoration style across reviews"
      - "Maintain consistent section header symbols"
      - "Develop signature introduction and conclusion patterns"
    rationale: "Consistent formatting creates recognition and personal branding across multiple reviews"

  principles:
    - name: "Visual Hierarchy"
      description: "Creating clear visual importance levels"
      implementation:
        - "Use largest formatting (headers) for most important sections"
        - "Apply mid-level formatting (subheaders) for secondary elements"
        - "Use subtle formatting for tertiary elements"
      rationale: "Helps readers quickly identify and navigate to relevant information"
    
    - name: "Consistency"
      description: "Maintaining predictable formatting patterns"
      implementation:
        - "Use the same formatting for the same purpose throughout"
        - "Apply consistent symbol usage across all reviews"
        - "Maintain regular section order when possible"
      rationale: "Creates familiarity and ease of navigation for readers"
    
    - name: "Minimalism"
      description: "Using formatting judiciously for maximum impact"
      implementation:
        - "Limit decorative elements to essential locations"
        - "Avoid multiple attention-grabbing elements in close proximity"
        - "Choose fewer, more impactful formatting techniques"
      rationale: "Prevents visual noise that distracts from content value"
    
    - name: "Functionality"
      description: "Ensuring formatting serves specific purposes"
      implementation:
        - "Each formatting choice should solve a specific readability problem"
        - "Decorative elements should enhance rather than hinder information processing"
        - "Test whether formatting improves content accessibility"
      rationale: "Keeps formatting focused on enhancing user experience"

    ▓▒░ Tales from a Kitchen Lab: The 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles ░▒▓
    
    I heard the *clink* from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood. Standard glass-breakage scenario initiated: broom deployment, dustpan maneuvers, followed by tactical tweezer operations for rogue foot-shard extraction. Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity, one of our $9 duo chose a more... theatrical exit.
    
    ► THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS
    The surviving cup found its calling under my espresso machine. That pour spout? Actually understands fluid dynamics - directing my precious caffeine without the usual counter splatter. But here's the real discovery: fill one past the final 70ml marking (yes, ALL the way up), and you've got the perfect kernel load for a Chinese popcorn cannon. (Yes, that's a real thing, and yes, it's as awesome as it sounds.)
    
    ■ THE SPECS
    ✓ PROS
    - Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses
    - Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)
    - Pour spout that actually works
    - Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science
    
    ✗ CONS
    - Fragile as my ego after someone criticizes my coffee technique
    - Glass thickness suggests it was designed for a gentler universe
    - Advertised as 3oz, but highest marking is 2.5oz (though there's bonus space above)
    
    ☞ THE PRECISION SEEKERS:
    - Coffee enthusiasts needing precise measurements for pour-overs or espresso shots
    - Recipe developers working with small amounts of ingredients
    - Mixologists crafting cocktails requiring exact measurements
    - Detail-oriented cooks who get frustrated with "eyeballing" small quantities
    
    ☜ NOT FOR THE CAREFREE COOK:
    - Households with young kids (fragile glass)
    - Anyone cooking primarily large-batch recipes where precision is less critical
    
    ※ FIELD NOTES
    - Keep the box for storage - these aren't drawer-rummaging tools
    - Perfect for pour-over coffee measurements
    - Use with a scale for ultimate kitchen science
    
    ► RESEARCH CONCLUSIONS
    At $9 for two, they're solid tools for kitchen precision - just maybe keep one in a protective bunker as backup. Perfect for coffee enthusiasts, careful measurers, and anyone who's muttered "but how much is a 'splash' exactly?" while cooking.
