# Core Information-Personality Balance
# =============================================================================
content_ratios:
  description: "The fundamental balance between informational content and personality"
  
  baseline_ratios:
    informational: 55
    personality: 40
    flexibility: 5
    note: "Percentages represent content allocation across the entire review"
  
  personality_components:
    humor: 45
    personal_experience: 35
    conversational_elements: 20
    note: "Percentages of personality content (not of total review content)"
  
  implementation_principles:
    - "Information should always precede personality within each content element"
    - "Core facts must be preserved regardless of personality ratio"
    - "Personality elements should enhance rather than obscure information"
    - "Balance should be assessed at both the section and review level"
    - "Different sections can have different ratios based on their purpose"

# =============================================================================
# Product Type Adjustments
# =============================================================================
product_type_adjustments:
  description: "Modifications to personality ratio based on product category"
  
  adjustments:
    - type: "Photography/Visual Arts Equipment"
      personality_adjustment: "+10-15%"
      rationale: "Creative product categories support higher personality content"
    
    - type: "Technical/Precision Tools"
      personality_adjustment: "+5-10%"
      rationale: "Technical users appreciate creative perspectives on specialized tools"
    
    - type: "Medical/Health Products"
      personality_adjustment: "-5-10%"
      rationale: "Health-related products benefit from more direct informational content"
    
    - type: "Basic Household Essentials"
      personality_adjustment: "+5-10%"
      rationale: "Everyday products need personality to differentiate from similar reviews"
    
    - type: "Luxury/Premium Products"
      personality_adjustment: "+5-15%"
      rationale: "Premium product reviews benefit from experiential and emotional content"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Adjust baseline ratio before beginning review drafting"
    - "Consider specific product subcategory, not just broad category"
    - "Use the middle of the adjustment range as default"
    - "Fine-tune based on product complexity and target audience"

# =============================================================================
# Section-Specific Adjustments
# =============================================================================
section_specific_adjustments:
  description: "Different review sections require different personality ratios"
  
  content_type_allocations:
    - content_type: "Opening/Introduction Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Higher personality engages readers initially"
      example: "I heard the clink from the next room - that all-too-familiar sound of glass meeting hardwood..."
    
    - content_type: "Technical/Specification Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-15%"
      rationale: "Technical details require more direct information"
      example: "Battery life: 8.5 hours in continuous testing (vs. 10 hours claimed)."
    
    - content_type: "Evaluation Content"
      personality_adjustment: "-10%"
      rationale: "Assessment needs clarity with some personality"
      example: "PROS: Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses."
    
    - content_type: "Conclusion/Verdict Content"
      personality_adjustment: "+5%"
      rationale: "Slightly higher personality creates memorable closing"
      example: "At $9 for two, they're solid tools for kitchen precision..."
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Apply adjustments based on content's purpose rather than section name"
    - "A section may contain multiple content types requiring different personality levels"
    - "These adjustments modify the baseline personality ratio"
    - "Adjustments are cumulative with product type adjustments"

# =============================================================================
# Front-Loading Implementation
# =============================================================================
front_loading:
  description: "The principle of placing essential information before personality elements"
  
  core_principle:
    definition: "Always place essential information FIRST in every sentence or list item"
    rationale: "Ensures core information is preserved regardless of how content is scanned"
  
  implementation_examples:
    - type: "Sentences"
      bad: "Like upgrading from economy to business class, this battery charges quickly."
      good: "This battery charges in under 2 hours, like upgrading from economy to business class."
      explanation: "Good example front-loads factual information before adding personality"
    
    - type: "List Items"
      bad: "A joy to use with its comfortable grip and precise control."
      good: "Comfortable grip with precise control that makes lengthy sessions a joy instead of a chore."
      explanation: "Good example starts with factual elements before adding emotional response"
  
  exceptions:
    - "Opening hook sentences (where personality creates stronger engagement)"
    - "Transitional sentences between sections"
  
  implementation_guidance:
    - "Check each sentence during editing to verify information comes first"
    - "Be particularly vigilant with list items, which are often scanned"
    - "For complex features, lead with most important specification"
    - "Front-loading should become automatic with practice"

# =============================================================================
# List Item Strategy
# =============================================================================
list_item_strategy:
  description: "Approach for effectively incorporating personality into list items"
  
  core_principles:
    - "Enhance 30-40% of list items with personality, always after core information"
    - "Select the most distinctive or important features for enhancement"
    - "Ensure enhancement complements rather than competes with core information"
    - "Distribute personality elements throughout lists rather than clustering"
  
  enhancement_types:
    - name: "Comparative Enhancements"
      example:
        basic: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously"
        enhanced: "Charges 10 AA/AAA batteries plus 2 9V simultaneously, perfect for flash-addicted photographers with battery dependencies"
    
    - name: "Experiential Enhancements"
      example:
        basic: "One-handed operation with intuitive controls"
        enhanced: "One-handed operation with intuitive controls (crucial when holding a squirming baby in the other arm)"
    
    - name: "Humorous Enhancements"
      example:
        basic: "Silicone grip prevents slipping even with wet hands"
        enhanced: "Silicone grip prevents slipping even with wet hands (goodbye, kitchen floor soup disasters)"
  
  implementation_example:
    pros_list:
      - "Perfect size between bulky measuring cups and tiny shot glasses"
      - "Speaks both metric and imperial (sophisticated!)"
      - "Pour spout that actually works"
      - "Ideal for coffee precision and popcorn science"
      notes: "Second and fourth items include personality, representing 50% enhancement"

# Content Chunk Management
# =============================================================================
content_chunk_management:
  description: "Strategies for balancing information and personality at different content levels"
  
  sentence_level:
    principles:
      - "Vary sentence complexity and length for rhythm"
      - "Limit personality-heavy sentences to 25-30% of total"
      - "Follow complex information with simpler sentences"
      - "Ensure key information appears in straightforward sentences"
  
  paragraph_level:
    principles:
      - "Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph for readability"
      - "Begin paragraphs with informational foundation"
      - "Build personality elements on established information"
      - "Conclude paragraphs with either key information or memorable personality"
  
  section_level:
    principles:
      - "Match content chunk size to information complexity"
      - "Use shorter paragraphs for technical information"
      - "Balance information-heavy paragraphs with personality-rich transitions"
      - "Ensure each section contains at least one memorable personality element"

  pre_writing_planning:
    mandatory_steps:
      - "Calculate target personality ratio for this product category"
      - "Pre-determine section-specific personality targets"
      - "Pre-select list items for personality enhancement"
      - "Choose appropriate personality techniques (see personality-techniques.yaml)"

    - name: "Reader Perspective Test"
      process: "Read content from both fact-focused and experience-focused perspectives"
  
  balance_correction:
    information_deficit:
      indicators: "Too few specifications, abundant personality without supporting facts"
      resolution: "Add specific measurements and performance details"
    
    personality_deficit:
      indicators: "Dry technical listing, lack of experiential context"
      resolution: "Add specific usage scenarios and experiences"
    
    uneven_distribution:
      indicators: "Some sections overly technical, others excessively personal"
      resolution: "Redistribute personality elements more evenly"
