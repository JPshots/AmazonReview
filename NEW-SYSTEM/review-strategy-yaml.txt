# Foundation that establishes goals, principles, and success metrics for Amazon Vine program reviews

# =============================================================================
# Core Review Goals and Strategies
# =============================================================================
review_goal:
  primary: "Create reviews of exceptional quality that qualify for the Amazon Vine program"
  strategies:
    - "Write the most helpful reviews possible for potential buyers"
    - "Provide genuine, comprehensive product insights"
    - "Balance information with engaging personality"
    - "Deliver value that exceeds typical product reviews"

# =============================================================================
# Core Value Drivers
# =============================================================================
value_drivers:
  - driver: "Authentic Personal Experience"
    description: "Genuine testing and usage provides credibility and insight"
    implementation:
      - "Include specific usage scenarios with contextual details"
      - "Document real-world application beyond theoretical use"
      - "Share unexpected discoveries during testing"
    examples:
      - "After three years of struggling with butterfly popcorn dissolving on contact, these mushroom kernels..."
      - "The silicone grip eliminates that plastic-on-countertop clatter that wakes sleeping babies."

  - driver: "Comprehensive Information"
    description: "Complete product understanding that goes beyond surface details"
    implementation:
      - "Cover technical specifications with actual measurements"
      - "Discuss performance across multiple use cases"
      - "Address both expected and unexpected applications"
    examples:
      - "The 70ml capacity and dual measurement systems (oz/ml) make it perfect for precise coffee measurement."
      - "At $8 per bag with an average 15-use lifespan, each popcorn session costs about 53 cents."

  - driver: "Strategic Balance"
    description: "Optimized mix of information and personality creates engaging, helpful content"
    implementation:
      - "Maintain appropriate information/personality ratio based on product category"
      - "Front-load information before adding personality"
      - "Adjust balance based on product category and section purpose"
    reference: "See personality-core.yaml for detailed implementation guidance"

  - driver: "Differentiated Insight"
    description: "Unique perspectives that distinguish review from standard content"
    implementation:
      - "Test product in unconventional scenarios"
      - "Compare with alternatives not mentioned in product description"
      - "Document edge cases and performance limitations"
    examples:
      - "Unlike our nearly indestructible glass baby bottles that laugh in the face of gravity..."
      - "While standard air poppers don't create the same perfect spheres, the cannon method gives you popcorn with architectural integrity."
