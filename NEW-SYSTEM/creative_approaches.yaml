# Thematic Framework Core
# =============================================================================
thematic_framework_core:
  description: "Foundational principles for developing unique thematic approaches"
  
  core_principles:
    - "Unique themes emerge from authentic product experiences rather than forced frameworks"
    - "Effective themes create unexpected connections between the product and other domains"
    - "Themes should enhance information clarity rather than obscuring it"
    - "Your personal expertise, interests, and background are valuable sources for unique themes"
    - "Consistent thematic implementation creates more memorable reviews than scattered creative elements"
  
  theme_discovery_process:
    questions:
      - "What metaphorical domain naturally connects to this product's function?"
      - "What unexpected comparison came to mind during product testing?"
      - "What process outside the product's domain does the usage experience remind you of?"
      - "What unlikely profession would benefit from the skills needed to use this product well?"
      - "What historical era or movement does this product's design or function evoke?"
    process:
      - "Note potential themes during product testing phase"
      - "Consider 2-3 candidates before selecting final theme"
      - "Choose theme that naturally complements product characteristics"
      - "Verify theme can be consistently applied throughout review"

# Creative Inspiration Methods

creative_inspiration:
  description: "Techniques for generating unique thematic approaches"
  
  cross_domain_mapping:
    description: "Identifying unexpected connections between product and unrelated domains"
    process:
      - "Identify core product attributes and functions"
      - "Consider completely unrelated domains (nature, history, professions, etc.)"
      - "Look for surprising parallels or functional similarities"
      - "Develop connection into consistent thematic framework"
    examples:
      - product: "Baby thermometer"
        connection: "Medieval siege warfare"
        rationale: "Both involve careful timing, precision, and strategic patience"
      - product: "Coffee scale"
        connection: "Scientific laboratory"
        rationale: "Both emphasize precision measurement and methodical processes"
  
  personal_expertise_transfer:
    description: "Applying your unique knowledge domains to product reviews"
    process:
      - "Identify areas of personal expertise or deep interest"
      - "Look for natural connections to product functionality"
      - "Apply domain-specific vocabulary to product description"
      - "View product evaluation through this specialized lens"
    examples:
      - expertise: "Software development"
        product: "Multi-step skincare system"
        application: "Framework of initialization, processing, and output phases"
      - expertise: "Music"
        product: "Kitchen knife"
        application: "Terminology of balance, rhythm, and composition"
  
  unexpected_perspective_shift:
    description: "Viewing products from unusual vantage points"
    perspectives:
      - "Historical figure encountering modern product"
      - "Product personification (the item's perspective)"
      - "Specialized professional using product outside intended domain"
      - "Future archaeologist discovering product"
    example:
      perspective: "Medieval lord encountering smart home system"
      application: "Theme of 'Lord of the Digital Manor' with servants (automation) and castle security (smart locks)"

# Implementation Framework
# =============================================================================
implementation_framework:
  description: "System for consistently applying thematic elements throughout reviews"
  
  thematic_anchor_points:
    description: "Strategic locations for thematic element placement"
    key_points:
      - location: "Title and Opening"
        purpose: "Establish thematic framework"
        example: "Tales from a Kitchen Lab: The 3oz Glass Measuring Cup Chronicles"
      - location: "Section Headers"
        purpose: "Reinforce theme through structure"
        example: "Standard 'DAILY USE' becomes 'THE DAILY EXPERIMENTS'"
      - location: "Section Transitions"
        purpose: "Maintain thematic continuity"
      - location: "Conclusion/Verdict"
        purpose: "Create thematic closure"
        example: "Our experiments confirm this delivers laboratory-grade precision"
  
  thematic_vocabulary:
    description: "Creating consistent terminology aligned with chosen theme"
    process:
      - "Identify 8-12 key terms from thematic domain"
      - "Create mapping to product-specific concepts"
      - "Use terminology consistently throughout review"
    example:
      theme: "Kitchen Lab"
      mapping:
        - "Using product → Conducting experiments"
        - "Features → Laboratory equipment"
        - "Performance issues → Experimental anomalies"
  
  thematic_intensity_guide:
    description: "Guidelines for varying thematic presence across review sections"
    principle: "Adjust thematic intensity based on information complexity"
    recommendations:
      - section: "Technical Content"
        intensity: "Low - prioritize information clarity"
      - section: "Experiential Content"
        intensity: "Medium - balance information and theme"
      - section: "Evaluation Content"
        intensity: "Medium-low - theme 30-40% of evaluation points"
      - section: "Verdict/Conclusion"
        intensity: "Medium-high - reinforce theme at closure"

# Balancing Creativity and Clarity
# =============================================================================
creativity_clarity_balance:
  description: "Ensuring thematic elements enhance rather than obscure information"
  reference: "See authentic-voice.yaml for detailed guidelines on maintaining authenticity with creative elements"
  
  core_principles:
    - "Theme serves content, not content serving theme"
    - "Core product information must remain absolutely clear"
    - "Thematic elements should enhance memorability without reducing clarity"
    - "Technical information requires lighter thematic treatment"
  
  information_prioritization:
    - priority: "Critical Information (specifications, price, core functions)"
      treatment: "Minimal theming - present directly with light thematic framing"
    - priority: "Important Information (performance details, comparisons)"
      treatment: "Moderate theming - integrate theme after clear information"
    - priority: "Supporting Information (context, personal experience)"
      treatment: "Strong theming - can be extensively themed while remaining clear"
  
  warning_signs:
    - "Theme obscures basic product information"
    - "Reader must 'decode' themed language to understand details"
    - "Specialized thematic vocabulary dominates over product information"
    - "Theme feels forced rather than natural extension of product experience"
